## Basic Content Development
This guide provides the basics on creating content for Vectorworks. It applies to third parties adding content to the application, as well as those providing content to their own customers via manufacturer product pages, BIM hosting sites, or other types of content hosting. It provides insight and comparisons on how Vectorworks develops some of its resources for inclusion within the application, and our recommendations for third party content developers.
